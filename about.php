                        Hello I’m Nkurunziza Emmanuel, welcome to my personal finance and entrepreneur blog! I created
                        this
                        blog as a place to empower others to have Financial and Entrepreneurial skills.
                        I am a young adult who graduated from the former School of Finance and Banking (SFB), now
                        University
                        of Rwanda College of Business and Economics with undergraduate business BBA Finance degree and
                        did
                        courses in Enterprise management and money management skills. Igishoro was created to empower
                        people especially the youth by giving them entrepreneurial Skills and financial literacy skills
                        that will help
                        have basic money management skills.
                        Research shows that by 2030 More than 300 Million Africans mostly the Youth will be unemployed
                        and
                        in need of jobs. Many people have low or no entrepreneurial and financial literacy skills and
                        this hinders
                        them to take their Ideas and financial decisions to a further step and create wealth out them.

                                        Starting a business from scratch and keeping it running requires a lot of
                                        efforts.

                                    Anyone can be an entrepreneur, Starting a small business is an exciting venture, but
                                    succeeding at
                                    managing the business is also not an easy task but most importantly managing your
                                    finances are the key
                                    moments of your life, all it takes is that one must have passion, ambition, dream
                                    big, think long term, be
                                    focused and use talents and skills that one has. The most important assets we people
                                    have are our mind,
                                    information and time, and if our mind is well trained and developed they can create
                                    wealth. We were
                                    not taught financial literacy at school, so we should change our thinking to become
                                    financially literate by
                                    preparing ourselves to learn. We must invest your time in financial education so
                                    that we build a firm
                                    financial foundation.

                                        Capital is not the only factor that one needs for a business success, but also
                                        better execution strategy of a business is required.
                                    </a>
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    While having capital is certainly important, it is not a guarantee to the business
                                    success. Most funded
                                    Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMES) and Projects do fail not necessarily as a
                                    result of not being
                                    funded or not given seed capital, but rather lack of entrepreneurial skills,
                                    financial literacy skills and
                                    poor execution. We always focus on capital as the most factor to the success of a
                                    business, but capital is
                                    just a catalyst and not a replacement for better execution strategy. As capital is
                                    not always enough, we
                                    should also learn to start small and grow big and do more with less that we have
                                    .This is a great principle
                                    of value to learn as in most cases capital is always not enough to start a business.
