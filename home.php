                  Starting a business from scratch and keeping it running requires a lot of efforts.

                <p class="mb-3">
                  Anyone can be an entrepreneur, Starting a small business is an exciting venture, but succeeding at managing the business is also not an easy task but most importantly managing your finances are the key moments of your life, all it takes is that one must have passion, ambition, perseverance, resilience, think long term, be focused and use talents and skills that one has. The most important assets we people have are our mind, information and time, and if our mind is well trained and developed it can create wealth. We were not taught financial literacy at school, so we should change our thinking to become financially literate by preparing ourselves to learn. We must invest our time in financial education so that we build a firm financial foundation.

                  Capital is not the only factor that one needs for the business to succeed, but also better execution strategy of the business is required.
                </a></h2>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  While having capital is certainly important, it is not a guarantee to the business success. Most funded Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMES) and Projects do fail not necessarily as a result of not being funded or not given enough seed capital, but rather lack of entrepreneurial skills, financial literacy skills and poor execution of the business. We always focus on capital as the most factor to the success of a business, but capital is just a catalyst and not a replacement for better execution strategy.  As capital is also not always enough, we should learn to start small and grow big later and do more with the little capital that we have .This is a great principle of value to learn as  in most cases capital is always not enough to start a business.
